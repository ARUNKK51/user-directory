Material UI components for consistent design

Confirmation dialog before deleting users

Centralized API layer using Axios

Environment-based configuration using .env

Tech Stack
React (Vite)
Material UI (MUI)
Axios
MockAPi-server (mock backend for local development)
Git & GitHub
Vercel (deployment)


⚙️ Environment Variables
Create  .env file in the project root:

Env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
In Vite, environment variables must start with VITE_.
The .env file is ignored by Git for security and flexibility across environments.
